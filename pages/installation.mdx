# Installation
 
Before creating your first Phenomine project, you should ensure that your local machine
has PHP and Composer installed. After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Phenomine project via the Composer create-project command:

```sh copy
composer create-project phenomine/phenomine project-name
```

After the project has been created, start Phenomine's local development server using the Phenomine's CLI `serve` command:

```sh copy
cd project-name
php phenomine serve
```

Once you have started the Phenomine development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`. Of course, you are free to configure the serve command with a different port number if desired.

If you want to use different port to run your application, you can use the `--port` option:

```sh copy
php phenomine serve --port=80 --host=0.0.0.0
```

That's it! Now go build something cool.
