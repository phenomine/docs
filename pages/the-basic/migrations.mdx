# Database Migrations

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema after pulling in your changes from source control, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.

## Generating Migration
You may use the `make:migration` command to generate a database migration. The new migration will be placed in your `db/migrations` directory. Each migration filename contains a timestamp that allows Phenomine to determine the order of the migrations:

```sh copy
php phenomine make:migration users
```

Running `make:migration` command with table name argument.

## Migration Structure
A migration class contains two methods: up and down. The up method is used to add new columns to your database, while the down method should reverse the operations performed by the up method.

```php copy
<?php

use Phenomine\Support\Database\Migration;

class migration_20231110113113_users extends Migration {
    protected $table = 'users';

    public function up() {
         $this->id();
         $this->string('name');
         $this->string('email')->unique();
    }

    public function down() {
        $this->dropTableIfExists();
    }
}

```
You must specify the table name on the migration file.

## Running Migrations
To run all of your outstanding migrations, execute the migrate command:

```sh copy
php phenomine migrate
```

## Rolling Back Migrations
To roll back the latest migration operation, you may use the rollback command. This command rolls back the last "batch" of migrations, which may include multiple migration files:

```sh copy
php phenomine migrate:rollback
```


## Columns
### Creating Columns
To create a new column, you may define in `up()` method. For the example.

```php copy
public function up() {
     $this->id();
     $this->string('name');
     $this->string('email')->unique();
}
```
### Available Column Types
The table builder blueprint offers a variety of methods that correspond to the different types of columns you can add to your database tables. Each of the available methods are listed below:

```php copy
public function up() {
     $this->id();
     $this->string('name');
     $this->integer('age');
     $this->boolean('active');
     $this->date('birthdate');
     $this->datetime('registered_at');
     $this->time('active_hour');
     $this->timestamp('updated_at');
     $this->decimal('point', [10,2])
     $this->float('float_type');
     $this->double('value', [8,2]);
     $this->bigint('number');
     $this->text('address');
}
```

You can specify the length of column with passing length parameter to migration.

### Column Modifiers
In addition to the column types listed above, there are several column "modifiers" you may use when adding a column to a database table. For example, to make the column "nullable", you may use the nullable method:

Modifier  |  Description
--------  |  -----------
`->autoIncrement()`  |  Set INTEGER columns as auto-incrementing.
`->comment('my comment')`  |  Add a comment to a column (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
`->default($value)`  |  Specify a "default" value for the column.
`->nullable($value = true)`  |  Allow NULL values to be inserted into the column.
`->unsigned()`  |  Set INTEGER columns as UNSIGNED (MySQL).
`->primaryKey()` | Set column as PRIMARY KEY
`->unique()` | Set column must UNIQUE

## Drop Table
To drop an existing table, you may use the `dropIfExists` method on `down()`:

```php copy

public function down() {
    $this->dropTableIfExists();
}


```
Phenomine automatically dropping table that defined on migration when rollback function called.
