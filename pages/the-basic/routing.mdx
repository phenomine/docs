# Routing

Routing in web applications is a way to map URLs to specific pages in the application. For example, if you have a page that displays a list of products, you might want to map the URL `/products` to that page. If you have a page that displays a single product, you might want to map the URL `/products/123` to that page, where `123` is the ID of the product to display.

Phenomine has a built-in router that allows you to map URLs to pages in your application. There are several approaches to defining routes in Phenomine:

## Basic Routing
The most basic Phenomine routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing configuration files:

```php showLineNumbers filename="routes/routes.php" {3-5} copy
use Phenomine\Support\Route;

Route::get('/', function() {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```
