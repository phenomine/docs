# Release Notes

## Versioning Scheme
Phenomine follow Semantic Versioning. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

When referencing the Phenomine framework or its components from your application or package, you should always use a version constraint such as ^2.0, since major releases of Phenomine do include breaking changes. However, we strive to always ensure you may update to a new major release in one day or less.

## Phenomine 2
Phenomine 2 continues the improvements made in Phenomine 1.x by introducing the support for simple object-relational mapping (ORM) as well as all stub files used to generate models throughout the framework. In addition to support the ORM, we also added database seeders support with developer-friendly to intreact with console using `db:seed` command. We also simplify some naming function in core framework.


### PHP 8.0
Phenomine 2.x requires a minimum PHP version of 8.0.

### .env File
Phenomine uses `.env` files to store configurations for your applications. In starter project, we include the `.env.example` file that can you rename to use in your application.

```env
APP_NAME="The Phenomine Framework"
APP_ENV=local #production, local

DB_DRIVER=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=phenomine
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### Exception Handler
We also introducing new exception handler with custom user-friendly UI to show error stack trace. Developer can disable this error message by changing environment to `production`.

### Model 
We added support for the Model class which can help you to access the database more easily out-of-the-box. To ensure model can work properly, you need to use plural table name on database. For example table name `users` the model name `User`. Phenomine will automatically determine this naming convention.
If you dont follow this naming rule, you can also override the table name setting by changing `protected $table = 'name';` attribute to the model.

To create new model, you can use:
```sh
php phenomine make:model User
```

or if you want to create a new model with migration in one command, you can use `--m` option. For example:
```sh
php phenomine make:model User --m
```

This command, will create a model and migration file.

### Database Seeders
We added support for the database seeder class which can help you to seed the database more easily out-of-the-box. 

To create new seeder, you can use:
```sh
php phenomine make:seeder UserSeeder
```
Where `UserSeeder` is your seeder name. Feel free to change this name.

Inside the seeder you will see:
```php
<?php

use App\Models\User;
use Phenomine\Support\Seeder;

class UserSeeder extends Seeder {

    public function run() {
        User::create([
            'name' => 'Fahli Saputra',
            'email' => 'fahli@opensource.fahli.net'
        ]);
    }

}
```

You can create data inside `run()` function. After that, you can run seeder with:
```sh
php phenomine db:seed 
```
